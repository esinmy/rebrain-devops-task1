# Books grabber from tululu.org

> This app helps you to download science fiction books in bulk from [tululu.org](https://tululu.org/).

## Background

This app and README.md is created for educational purposes in the online courses for web developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/) and for DevOps engineers [rebrainme.com](https://rebrainme.com/)

## Usage

User can provide category's start and end page using optional arguments `--start_page` and `--end_page` respectively.  
For example, to download all category's books from pages 10 to 20, run:
```
python parse_tululu_category.py --start_page 10 --end_page 20
```
By default, `--start_page` is equal to `1`, `--end-page` is equal to the last page number of the desired category.  

For convenience, shortcuts `-s` instead of `--start_page` and `-e` instead of `--end_page` can be used:
```
python parse_tululu_category.py -s 5 -e 15
```
